NAME
    Data::TxnBuffer - Module abstract (<= 44 characters) goes here

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::TxnBuffer;
    
        # create buffer
        my $buf = Data::TxnBuffer->new;
        # or create buffer from some data
        my $buf = Data::TxnBuffer->new( data => $data );
    
        # read some data
        use Try::Tiny;
        try {
            my $u32   = $buf->read_u32; # read unsigned int
            my $bytes = $buf->read(10); # read 10 bytes
    
            $buf->spin; # all data received. clear these data from buffer.
        } catch {
            $buf->reset; # reset read cursor. try again later
        };
    
        # or more easy way. this way automatically call spin or reset method like above.
        try {
            $buf->txn_read(sub {
                my $u32   = $buf->read_u32; # read unsigned int
                my $bytes = $buf->read(10); # read 10 bytes
            });
        } catch {
            # try again later
        };
    
    
        # write some data to filehandle or buffer
        $buf->write_u32(100);
        $buf->write("Hello World");
    
        # got written data
        my $data = $buf->data;
    
        # clear all data from buffer
        $buf->clear;

DESCRIPTION
    Stub documentation for this module was created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.
    It looks like the author of the extension was negligent enough to leave
    the stub unedited.

    Blah blah blah.

CLASS METHOD
  my $buf = Data::TxnBuffer->new($data);
    Create a Data::TxnBuffer object. If you passed some $data, create buffer
